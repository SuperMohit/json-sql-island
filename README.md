# Sql query from json input

* This is a sample implementation of a SQL parser from a JSON file
* Application is built using Interpreter pattern. 
* Each clause is a node of the Parse tree and the child nodes are next clauses. For instance SELECT is a parent node which would then for the child node like FROM  
* First, it would build a parse or syntax Tree.
* Second, it would traverse the syntax tree and build the expression for the SQL
* Print the SQL to the console

Input json file can be supplied as input to the command line. Default is input.json. 
There is a default json stored in resources which would be executed incase no input.json is supplied to command line.
